For this to work, you need your own API credits (which you CAN get for free)

You'll be prompted to link you API key, which can be found here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys



This extension is mostly for personal use, and rarely works on pdf documents, incredibly long articles, or any paywall remover bypasses (eg archive, removepaywalls.com, etc)

View your current/remaining API credits here: https://platform.openai.com/usage
Also able to buy new credits there ^^
